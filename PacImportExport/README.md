# Godot Engine's "Better" Collada exporter for Blender

Enhanced Collada exporter for [Blender](https://www.blender.org).

This tool has been modified for better compatibility with PACtool.

## Installation

1. Copy the `io_scene_pac` directory, to the location where Blender stores the
   scripts/addons folder on your system (you should see other io_scene_*
   folders there from other addons)
   If you downloaded blender through steam, the directory path is:
   SteamInstallDir\steamapps\common\Blender\<newest blender version>\scrips\addons
   Copy the entire dir and not just its
   contents.
2. Go to the Blender settings and enable the "PAC format and Better Collada Exporter" plugin.
3. Enjoy full-featured PAC Import and Collada export.
3a. The PAC Import can be found at File>Import>PAC Import
3b. The PAC Export can be found at File>Export>PAC Export(not working)
3c. The better collada export can be found at File>Export>Better Callada (.dae)
